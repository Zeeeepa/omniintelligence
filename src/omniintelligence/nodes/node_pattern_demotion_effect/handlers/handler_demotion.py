"""Handler functions for pattern demotion from validated to deprecated status.

Pattern demotion logic: checking validated patterns
against demotion gates and emitting lifecycle events for those that meet failure
criteria. Demotion decisions are based on rolling window metrics from the pattern
feedback loop.

Event-Driven Architecture (OMN-1805)
------------------------------------
This handler no longer performs direct SQL UPDATEs to change pattern status.
Instead, it emits ModelPatternLifecycleEvent to Kafka for the reducer to process:

    Handler → Kafka (pattern-lifecycle-transition.v1) → Reducer → Effect Node → DB

This architecture ensures:
    - Single source of truth: Reducer enforces ALL status transitions
    - Audit trail: All transitions logged with request_id for idempotency
    - Consistency: Same validation path for auto-demote and manual disable
    - FSM compliance: Reducer validates transitions against contract.yaml

Philosophy: Don't Demote on Noise
---------------------------------
Demotion is a STRONGER signal than promotion. While promotion gates are optimistic
("this pattern shows promise"), demotion gates are conservative ("this pattern is
definitively failing"). This asymmetry prevents patterns from oscillating between
validated and deprecated states due to temporary noise or variance.

Key differences from promotion:
    - Higher injection count requirement (10 vs 5): Need more data to demote
    - Cooldown period: Cannot demote recently promoted patterns
    - Multiple paths to demotion: Both low success AND high failure streak
    - Manual disable as hard override: Bypasses all gates

Demotion Gates:
---------------
Any ONE of the following triggers demotion (after passing eligibility checks):

1. Manual Disable Gate (HARD TRIGGER):
   - Pattern exists in disabled_patterns_current table
   - BYPASSES cooldown - always demotes immediately
   - Sets reason = "manual_disable", actor_type = "admin"

2. Failure Streak Gate:
   - failure_streak >= MIN_FAILURE_STREAK (5)
   - Pattern is in a persistent failure spiral
   - Sets reason = "failure_streak: N consecutive failures", actor_type = "handler"

3. Low Success Rate Gate (requires sufficient data):
   - success_rate < MAX_SUCCESS_RATE (0.40)
   - AND injection_count_rolling_20 >= MIN_INJECTION_COUNT (10)
   - Sets reason = "low_success_rate: X%", actor_type = "handler"

Eligibility Checks (applied before demotion gates 2 & 3):
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Cooldown Period: Must wait DEFAULT_COOLDOWN_HOURS (24) since promotion
   - Prevents oscillation between promotion and demotion
   - Manual disable BYPASSES this check

2. Status Check: Pattern must be in 'validated' status
   - Already filtered in SQL query (WHERE status = 'validated')

Kafka Publisher Requirement:
----------------------------
The ``kafka_producer`` dependency is REQUIRED for the event-driven architecture.
When the Kafka publisher is unavailable (None), demotions CANNOT be processed
and the handler returns early with reason="kafka_producer_unavailable".

**Implications of running without Kafka:**

1. **No Demotions**: Without Kafka, lifecycle events cannot be emitted, and
   demotions will not occur. This is intentional - the reducer is the single
   source of truth for status transitions.

2. **Degraded Mode Detection**: Callers can detect this by checking
   ``ModelDemotionResult.reason == "kafka_producer_unavailable"``.

3. **Retry Strategy**: When Kafka becomes available, re-run the demotion check
   to emit lifecycle events for patterns that met demotion criteria.

Design Principles:
    - Pure functions for criteria evaluation (no I/O)
    - Protocol-based dependency injection for testability
    - Event-driven status changes via Kafka (no direct SQL UPDATE)
    - Reducer as single source of truth for FSM transitions
    - asyncpg-style positional parameters ($1, $2, etc.)
    - Stricter thresholds than promotion to prevent oscillation

Reference:
    - OMN-1805: Reducer-based status transitions (this refactor)
    - OMN-1681: Auto-demote logic for patterns
    - OMN-1680: Auto-promote logic (reference implementation)
    - OMN-1678: Rolling window metrics (dependency)

    """Request demotion of a pattern by emitting a lifecycle event.

    This function emits a ModelPatternLifecycleEvent to Kafka for the reducer
    to process. The actual status update happens asynchronously via the
    reducer → effect node pipeline (OMN-1805 architecture).

    **Event-Driven Flow**:
    1. This handler evaluates demotion criteria and builds gate snapshot
    2. Emits ModelPatternLifecycleEvent to pattern-lifecycle-transition topic
    3. Reducer validates transition against FSM contract
    4. Effect node applies the actual database UPDATE

    **Why Events Instead of Direct SQL?**
    - Single source of truth: Reducer enforces all status transitions
    - Audit trail: All transitions logged with request_id for idempotency
    - Consistency: Same validation path for auto-demote and manual disable

    Args:
        repository: Database repository (unused in event-driven mode, kept for
            interface compatibility during migration).
        producer: Kafka producer implementing ProtocolKafkaPublisher.
            REQUIRED for event emission. If None, returns early with error.
        pattern_id: The pattern ID to demote.
        pattern_data: Pattern record from SQL query (for gate snapshot).
        reason: The demotion reason string (e.g., "manual_disable",
            "failure_streak: 5 consecutive failures", "low_success_rate: 35.0%").
        thresholds: Effective thresholds used for this demotion.
        correlation_id: Optional correlation ID for tracing.

    Returns:
        ModelDemotionResult with demotion details and gate snapshot.
        The ``deprecated_at`` field indicates when the demotion was REQUESTED
        (not when it completes - that happens asynchronously).
        Returns ``deprecated_at=None`` if producer is None (cannot emit event).

    Note:
        The actual database UPDATE is performed by NodePatternLifecycleEffect
        after the reducer validates the transition. This function only emits
        the lifecycle event.

"""Policy lifecycle transition logic — table-driven, pure functions.

Lifecycle state machine transitions:
    CANDIDATE → VALIDATED when N runs with positive signal
    VALIDATED → PROMOTED  when statistical significance threshold met
    PROMOTED  → DEPRECATED when reliability falls below hard floor

Constraints:
    - NO scoring logic — only applies pre-computed reward deltas
    - Table-driven from ModelTransitionThresholds — no hardcoded if/else chains
    - Transitions are evaluated in priority order (degradation before promotion)

The public functions are pure: identical inputs → identical outputs.
All I/O (DB reads/writes, Kafka publishing) is handled by the node.

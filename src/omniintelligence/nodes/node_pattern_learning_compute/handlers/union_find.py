"""Union-Find (Disjoint-Set) data structure for clustering operations.

Reusable Union-Find implementation optimized for
deterministic clustering operations. It supports path compression for
efficient `find()` operations and guarantees deterministic behavior by
always selecting the smaller index as the root during union operations.

Union-Find Overview:
    Union-Find is a data structure that tracks a partition of elements into
    disjoint sets. It supports two primary operations:
    - find(x): Determine which set element x belongs to (returns the "root")
    - union(x, y): Merge the sets containing x and y

    This implementation uses:
    - Path compression: Flatten tree structure during find() for O(alpha(n)) amortized
    - Deterministic union: Smaller index always becomes root (not rank-based)

Determinism Guarantees:
    Unlike traditional rank-based union, this implementation prioritizes
    determinism over theoretical optimality:
    - The smaller index ALWAYS becomes the root
    - Given the same inputs, the same partition will always result
    - This enables reproducible clustering results

Performance:
    - find(): O(alpha(n)) amortized with path compression
    - union(): O(alpha(n)) amortized (dominated by find())
    - connected(): O(alpha(n)) amortized (two find() calls)
    - components(): O(n) to collect all groups

    Where alpha(n) is the inverse Ackermann function, effectively O(1) for all
    practical values of n.

Usage:
    from omniintelligence.nodes.node_pattern_learning_compute.handlers.union_find import (
        UnionFind,
    )

    # Create Union-Find for n=5 elements (indices 0-4)
    uf = UnionFind(5)

    # Merge sets containing indices 0 and 1
    uf.union(0, 1)

    # Check if 0 and 1 are in the same set
    assert uf.connected(0, 1) is True

    # Find the root of element 0
    root = uf.find(0)

    # Get all components (groups of connected indices)
    components = uf.components()  # {root: [indices...], ...}

class UnionFind:
    """Disjoint-set data structure with deterministic ordering.

    Union-Find with path compression and deterministic
    union rules suitable for single-linkage clustering where reproducibility
    is critical.

    Attributes:
        n: The number of elements (indices 0 to n-1).

    Determinism:
        The smaller index always becomes the root during union operations.
        This ensures that given the same sequence of union() calls, the
        resulting partition is identical regardless of call order within
        pairs.

    Examples:
        >>> uf = UnionFind(5)
        >>> uf.union(0, 2)
        >>> uf.union(1, 2)
        >>> uf.find(0) == uf.find(1) == uf.find(2)
        True
        >>> uf.find(0)  # Smallest index (0) is root

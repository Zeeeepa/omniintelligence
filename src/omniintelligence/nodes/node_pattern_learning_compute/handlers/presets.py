"""Default configuration presets for pattern learning.

Default values and constants for pattern learning operations.
These are INPUTS (configurable defaults), not canonical constants.

IMPORTANT:
    Weights and thresholds defined here are reasonable defaults that can be
    overridden by callers. They are NOT authoritative policy - policy decisions
    belong in higher-level orchestration nodes.

Signature Versioning:
    Pattern signatures are versioned to enable migration and comparison across
    algorithm changes. The version is stored alongside each signature.

Usage:
    from omniintelligence.nodes.node_pattern_learning_compute.handlers.presets import (
        SIGNATURE_VERSION,
        DEFAULT_SIMILARITY_WEIGHTS,
    )

    # Use defaults or override
    weights = DEFAULT_SIMILARITY_WEIGHTS  # Use as-is
    weights = {**DEFAULT_SIMILARITY_WEIGHTS, "keyword": 0.35}  # Override one

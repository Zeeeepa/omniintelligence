"""Replay artifact emission for pattern learning handlers.

Protocol for emitting structured replay artifacts
during pattern learning operations. Artifacts enable replay comparison
and debugging of clustering decisions.

Design:
    - Protocol-based for dependency injection
    - NullEmitter for tests and when replay logging is disabled
    - JSON-safe payload enforcement

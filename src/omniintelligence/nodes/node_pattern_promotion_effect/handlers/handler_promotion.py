"""Handler functions for pattern promotion from provisional to validated status.

Pattern promotion logic: checking provisional patterns
against promotion gates and emitting lifecycle events for those that meet all
criteria. Promotion decisions are based on rolling window metrics from the pattern
feedback loop.

**Event-Driven Architecture (OMN-1805):**
-----------------------------------------
This handler does NOT directly update pattern status in the database. Instead,
it evaluates promotion gates and emits a ``ModelPatternLifecycleEvent`` to Kafka
when a producer is available. The reducer consumes this event, validates the
transition against contract.yaml, and the effect node applies the actual database
update.

Flow:
    1. Handler evaluates promotion gates (pure computation)
    2. If criteria met and producer is not None: emit ``ModelPatternLifecycleEvent`` to Kafka
    3. Reducer validates transition is allowed per contract FSM
    4. Effect node applies database UPDATE and emits transitioned event

This decoupling ensures:
    - Single source of truth for status transitions (reducer)
    - Full audit trail via Kafka events
    - Consistent FSM enforcement across all status changes
    - Eventual consistency (caller may return before status is updated)

Promotion Gates:
----------------
All four gates must pass for a pattern to be promoted:

1. Injection Count Gate: injection_count_rolling_20 >= MIN_INJECTION_COUNT (5)
   - Pattern must have been used enough times to have meaningful data

2. Success Rate Gate: success_rate >= MIN_SUCCESS_RATE (0.6 / 60%)
   - Calculated as: success_count / (success_count + failure_count)
   - Pattern must demonstrate consistent success

3. Failure Streak Gate: failure_streak < MAX_FAILURE_STREAK (3)
   - Pattern must not be in a recent failure spiral

4. Disabled Gate: Pattern must not be in disabled_patterns_current table
   - Already filtered in SQL query (LEFT JOIN ... IS NULL)

Kafka Publisher (Optional):
---------------------------
The ``kafka_producer`` dependency is OPTIONAL per the ONEX invariant:
"Effect nodes must never block on Kafka — Kafka is optional, operations must
succeed without it."

Always check ``if producer is not None`` before publishing. When Kafka is
unavailable (producer is None), promotion events are skipped with a warning
log. The operation succeeds without blocking. Callers should supply a live
``ProtocolKafkaPublisher`` instance when event-driven promotion is required;
passing None degrades gracefully.

Design Principles:
    - Pure functions for criteria evaluation (no I/O)
    - Protocol-based dependency injection for testability
    - Event-driven status changes via reducer (no direct SQL UPDATE)
    - Eventual consistency (status updated asynchronously)
    - Graceful degradation when Kafka is unavailable
    - asyncpg-style positional parameters ($1, $2, etc.)

    - OMN-1680: Auto-promote logic for patterns
    - OMN-1678: Rolling window metrics (dependency)
    - OMN-1679: Contribution heuristics (dependency)

Threshold Behavior:
    - 0 (zero-tolerance): ANY failure blocks promotion (failure_streak >= 0 always true
      if failure_streak > 0, so a single failure blocks)
    - 1: A single consecutive failure blocks promotion
    - 2: Two consecutive failures block promotion
    - 3 (default): Three consecutive failures block promotion

Note: The check is failure_streak < max_failure_streak, so with the default of 3,
exactly 3 consecutive failures BLOCKS promotion.

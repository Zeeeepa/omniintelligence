"""Handler functions for WatchdogEffect.

Two handler entry points for the filesystem watcher:

1. ``start_watching()``
   Starts the OS-level filesystem observer (FSEvents/inotify/polling) for
   all configured watched paths.  Registers an event handler that publishes
   ``{env}.onex.cmd.omnimemory.crawl-requested.v1`` on file change.

2. ``stop_watching()``
   Gracefully stops the active observer and clears module-level state.

Design: omni_save/design/DESIGN_OMNIMEMORY_DOCUMENT_INGESTION_PIPELINE.md §4

Handler Contract:
-----------------
ALL exceptions are caught and returned as structured ERROR results.
These functions never raise — unexpected errors produce a result with
status=EnumWatchdogStatus.ERROR.

Kafka Non-Blocking Pattern:
---------------------------
The watchdog event handler runs in a background thread (OS observer thread).
It schedules a coroutine on the asyncio event loop via
``loop.call_soon_threadsafe(loop.create_task, coro)``.  This ensures:
  - The observer thread is never blocked by Kafka I/O.
  - The Kafka publish is fully async on the main event loop.
  - No synchronous/blocking awaits in the observer thread.

Deduplication:
--------------
WatchdogEffect does NOT implement its own debounce.  It emits
``crawl-requested.v1`` with ``trigger_source=FILESYSTEM_WATCH`` and relies
on the per-source debounce guard in ``CrawlSchedulerEffect`` (30-second
window) to prevent phantom duplication from rapid saves.

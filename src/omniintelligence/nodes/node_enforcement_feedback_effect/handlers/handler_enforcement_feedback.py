"""Handler functions for enforcement feedback processing.

Enforcement feedback loop: when omniclaude's
PostToolUse hook detects pattern violations, it emits an enforcement event.
This handler consumes those events and applies conservative confidence
adjustments to violated patterns.

Conservative Adjustment Policy:
-------------------------------
A violation only counts toward confidence adjustment when ALL conditions
are met:
    1. The violation was detected (violation exists in the event)
    2. The agent was **advised** about the violation (was_advised=True)
    3. The agent subsequently **corrected** the violation (was_corrected=True)

When all conditions are met, the pattern's quality_score is decremented by
CONFIDENCE_ADJUSTMENT_PER_VIOLATION (-0.01). This is intentionally conservative
to prevent rapid erosion of pattern confidence from noisy enforcement data.

The quality_score is clamped to [0.0, 1.0] after adjustment.

Why require correction confirmation?
    If an agent was advised of a violation but did NOT correct it, we cannot
    confirm the violation was real. The advisory might have been a false
    positive, or the agent might have intentionally kept the code as-is.
    Only when the agent both receives advice AND acts on it can we be
    confident the violation was genuine.

SQL Pattern:
    Uses a single UPDATE with GREATEST(..., 0.0) clamping to ensure
    quality_score never goes below 0.0. Each confirmed violation applies
    CONFIDENCE_ADJUSTMENT_PER_VIOLATION independently.

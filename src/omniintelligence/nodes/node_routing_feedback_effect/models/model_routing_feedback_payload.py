"""Local model for the routing-feedback event payload consumed from omniclaude.

This is a consumer-side copy of ModelRoutingFeedbackPayload from omniclaude.
It defines only the fields this node consumes; additional producer fields are
silently ignored via ``extra='ignore'``.

OMN-2622: Switched subscription from routing-outcome-raw.v1 to routing-feedback.v1.
The producer (omniclaude) now emits all feedback outcomes (produced + skipped) on
routing-feedback.v1 with a ``feedback_status`` field. This consumer filters on
``feedback_status`` to decide whether to persist the record to routing_feedback_scores.

Reference: OMN-2622, OMN-2366, OMN-2935

    produced and skipped — are now emitted on the routing-feedback topic.

    - ``feedback_status == "skipped"``: guardrail blocked → skip DB write,

"""FSM-related enums for OmniIntelligence.

Canonical FSM type enumerations for the intelligence system.
These enums provide type safety for FSM operations in reducer and orchestrator nodes.

ONEX Compliance:
    - Enum-based naming: Enum{Category}
    - String-based enum for JSON serialization
    - Integration with Pydantic models

    This enum defines the primary FSM workflows supported by
    the intelligence reducer node.

    Attributes:
        INGESTION: Document ingestion workflow (RECEIVED -> PROCESSING -> INDEXED)
        PATTERN_LEARNING: Pattern learning workflow (4-phase: Foundation -> Matching -> Validation -> Traceability)
        QUALITY_ASSESSMENT: Quality assessment workflow (RAW -> ASSESSING -> SCORED -> STORED)
        PATTERN_LIFECYCLE: Pattern lifecycle management workflow (OMN-1805)

    Example:
        >>> from omniintelligence.enums import EnumFSMType
        >>> fsm_type = EnumFSMType.INGESTION
        >>> assert fsm_type.value == "INGESTION"

"""Domain taxonomy enum for OmniIntelligence.

Canonical domain taxonomy enumeration for pattern classification.
Domains must come from this versioned enum, not derived dynamically, to ensure
domain coherence as a quality gate for pattern promotion.

ONEX Compliance:
    - Enum-based naming: Enum{Category}
    - String-based enum for JSON serialization
    - Integration with Pydantic models

Ticket: OMN-1666

    """v1.0 - Domain taxonomy for pattern classification.

    This enum defines the canonical domains for classifying patterns.
    Domains provide a stable, versioned classification that prevents
    "wobble" from dynamically-derived classifications.

    Used as a quality gate for pattern promotion - patterns must have
    coherent domain classification before being promoted.

    Attributes:
        CODE_GENERATION: Creating new code
        CODE_REVIEW: Reviewing existing code
        DEBUGGING: Finding and fixing bugs
        TESTING: Writing or running tests
        DOCUMENTATION: Writing docs or comments
        REFACTORING: Restructuring existing code
        ARCHITECTURE: System design decisions
        DEVOPS: CI/CD, deployment, infra
        DATA_ANALYSIS: Data processing and analysis
        GENERAL: General purpose tasks

    Example:
        >>> from omniintelligence.enums import EnumDomainTaxonomy
        >>> domain = EnumDomainTaxonomy.CODE_GENERATION
        >>> assert domain.value == "code_generation"

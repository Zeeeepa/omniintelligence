"""E2E tests verifying real Kafka integration.

This module tests the real Kafka integration infrastructure provided by the
E2E fixtures. It verifies that:
- The RealKafkaPublisher can connect to Kafka and publish events
- Events are properly recorded for test assertion
- The consumer can verify events were actually published
- Topic isolation via prefix works correctly

These tests require real Kafka infrastructure at localhost:19092 (bus_local; see OMN-3477).
Tests are skipped gracefully when Kafka is unavailable.

    #
